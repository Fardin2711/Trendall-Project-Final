        "description": "CARC has confirmed the topic for this year's annual international workshop. Art under the Seleukid Empire: New Perspectives' will take place on 28-29 September 2023, with an in-person audience at Wolfson College Oxford and online via Zoom. An international line-up of speakers will lead a hybrid conversation about the character of art under the rule of the Hellenistic Seleukid dynasty, which extended at times from the Mediterranean to the Indus. We will think afresh about the character of Seleukid art, the extent to which it can be defined as an entity, and the new light cast by ongoing archaeological discoveries.Book now for free through our eventbrite page. All in-person attendees will also be given a Zoom link, so there is no need to book twice if you want both modes of attendance.The provisional programme is available for download here (note that last-minute changes may occur: check here for the latest version).The workshop has been organized in collaboration with Dr Rachel Wood and with the kind support from Tony Michaels and Wolfson College Oxford.",

The workshop will bring together invited international speakers and a worldwide audience to address a topic very closely related to Gandhara and vital for placing classical art in its global context: the question of how much mutual artistic exchange occurred between other parts of India, Greece and Rome in antiquity, and what we stand to learn by studying their art traditions alongside each other.Reservation, either for in person or online attendance, is free through our eventbrite page.Read the workshop abstract here. NEW! Speakers' abstracts now downloadable here. Read or download the latest version of the programme (note that small changes our expected, so check the latest version here).This colloquium builds on the success of CARC's past Gandhara Connections workshops. It is also the first event under our new #AncientArtConnections initiative. Through gatherings of this kind, as well as other research, publications, and web resources., we aim to explore many different aspects of the relationship between Greek and Roman art and the wider ancient world, across Asia, Africa, and Europe.This event is generously supported by the Bagri Foundation.",

        "img": "https://i.ibb.co/N3xK2m9/news3.jpg",
        "description": "Join us on Zoom at 09:00 GMT on Tuesday 8th March 2022 for a special seminar by Prof Mark Allon and Ian McCrabb of Sydney University, Australia: Digital Gandharan Texts â€“ The Digital Framework for the Research and Publication of Gandhari Manuscripts and Inscriptions. Allon and McCrabb will introduce their exciting project to document and disseminate Gandharan texts and artefacts. In conjunction with Gandhara scholars from the University of Washington (UW), Australian National University (ANU), Wilfred Laurier University, and other universities, Mark Allon and Ian McCrabb, both at University of Sydney (USYD), are leading the development of a digital framework (platform and methodology) for the collaborative research and publishing of Gandharan manuscripts and inscriptions, the foundation for their digital repatriation to the communities from which these important cultural artefacts originate. This presentation will give an account of these digital developments and digital repatriation strategy and their importance to the field of Gandharan studies. Mark Allon is Chair of the Department of Indian Subcontinental Studies at the University of Sydney. His primary research interests are the composition and transmission of early Buddhist literature, the ways in which texts have been used by Buddhist communities, and the Indic languages of early Buddhist texts (Pali, Gandhari, Sanskrit). He runs projects in Myanmar concerning Pali inscriptions at the Kuthodaw Pagoda, Mandalay, and in Pakistan concerning Gandhari manuscripts. He is part of a team of scholars and digital humanists at the University of Sydney, Australian National University, University of Washington, Stanford University and elsewhere developing digital capacity for the publication and study of Buddhist manuscripts and inscriptions, particularly those in Gandhari, Pali, and Sanskrit, e.g. Gandharan Buddhist Texts and the Journal of Gandharan Buddhist Texts. Ian McCrabb is the founder and managing director of Systemik, a Sydney based IT consulting group.  Systemik supports a portfolio of commercial and open-source humanities research platforms clustered around content transformation and text analysis.  Ian is the founder and director of Prakas Foundation, a non-profit association which supports digital scholarship in Buddhist studies and Sanskritic languages.  Prakas provides strategic planning and program management for platform developments.  His dissertation Buddha Bodies and the Benefits of Relic Establishment: Insights from a Digital Framework for the Analysis of Formulaic Sequences in Gandhari Relic Inscriptions was focussed on the ritual practices and religious significance of relic establishment in Gandhara.To book a place for free, please just email us: carc@classics.ox.ac.uk",
